			<h3>Club Activities</h3>
		<div class="container-fluid">
			<p>UoN Glding is an extremely active club, signing up over 100 members annually, nearly all of which come and fly with us at some point in the year. We fly every Saturday and Sunday during term time - weather permitting of course, but we can fly in a wider range of conditions than you probably think!</p>
			<p>We also run several expeditions each year, which any member is welcome to join us on, including our annual Easter trip to Portmoak in Scotland, the Inter-University competition in the summer and various weekends to other clubs as well.</p>
			<p>UoN Gliding is also a very active club socially - we meet every Tuesday during term time at Portland building on University Park and even on most Tuesdays in the holidays, where we will often relocate the social to another pub somewhere. A lot of socials are organised on other days during term time as well, previous events including ice skating, cinema trips, laser quest, paint balling, BBQs and trips to theme parks.</p>
			<p>We are also extremely active in the university gliding community, attending several inter university events throughout the year. Previous trips have seen us meet Edinburgh at Sutton Bank in Yorkshire for their fireworks party in November, spend New Year at the Long Mynd in Shropshire, and visit local clubs for the annual inter club league competition where we compete for and support our host club, Cranwell.</p>
			<p>This section of the site is dedicated to the current activities of the club, including weekly flying organisation and socials, as well as larger things like expeditions. There is an events calendar to help you find out when various activities are taking place, and information on how to get involved, how the club operates and what to do and bring on your first visit to the airfield.</p>
			<p>We hope that you as a member you will get involved with club activities, and fly with us regularly. Since we are such an active club, you can come as often or as little as you like, and get involved in some of the many socials we put on.</p>
			<p>See you on the airfield soon!</p>
