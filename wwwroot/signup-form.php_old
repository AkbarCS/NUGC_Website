				<p>Before continuing please make sure you have purchased a Gliding Membership from the <a href="https://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/sports/sport/Gliding/" target="_blank">SU website</a>. Without a membership, you won't be allowed to fly!</p>
				<p>If you are a regular member and have flown with us before you can skip straight to the signup form, if you are new to gliding then please take the time to read this page.</p>
				<p>New members signing up for the first time are <u>required to signup in person</u> to give you the chance to meet us and ask any questions you may have. It doesn't take long and normally involves a cheeky beer (or whatever you fancy) in Mooch afterwards! Signing up online without prior attending a signup session will result in your submission been removed.</p>
				<p>You can attend any of the sessions below to signup for the following weekend's flying:
					<ul>
<li>Tuesday 15th May, 7:00pm - Portland D137</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
				If you have any questions regarding the signup process, please email flyingorganiser@nugc.net
